Datafile: aggregation.arff, compound.arff, ds4c2sc8.arff, pathbased.arff, orange2.txt

Input: datafile name and lambda parameter, e.g. aggregation.arff 4.5. If nothing is given awc will run all data sets listed above.

Output: 'plot of 4 windows: 1. the weight matrix at the final step (white means 1, black is 0), 2. true weight matrix, 3. clustering based on the weight matrix, 4. true/wanted clustering.'

Example: run python awc.py aggregation.arff 4.5 to see the clustering results on the aggregation datafile.  By running python awc.py without specifying arguments, awc will run on the all listed data files.
